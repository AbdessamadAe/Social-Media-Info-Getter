# Social-Media-Info-Getter
Social media has a revolutionary impact on human behavior and 
society as it changed the way we behave, socialize, do business, build 
relationships, etc. Let’s have a look at active usage penetration of 
social media by country. I am providing you with a file called 
social_media.txt, that has data collected from www.statista.com, a 
leading provider of market and consumer data.

following menu options:
1. View the file content on screen 
2. Load the file content to an array
3. Get the country with the highest number of social media users
4. Sort data by number of social media users
5. Get a country’s social media data
